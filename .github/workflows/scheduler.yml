    # EXPLANATION: Safety timeout — prevents runaway jobs from burning Actions minutes.
    # A full scan cycle for 5-10 hotels typically takes 3-5 minutes.
    timeout-minutes: 30

    # EXPLANATION: Concurrency guard — only one scheduler instance runs at a time.
    # If a previous run is still executing, the new trigger is skipped.
    # This prevents duplicate scans when a run takes longer than 15 minutes.
