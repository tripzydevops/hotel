# 📊 Strategic Reporting Roadmap: Tiered Intelligence

This document outlines the architecture for transforming raw data into subscription-gated actionable intelligence.

## 💰 Monetization & Tier Gating

| Tier | Report Type | Access Level | Value Prop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Starter** | **CSV Raw Export** | Data Only | "Export your numbers for Excel manipulation." |
| **Pro** | **Executive Summary** | Strategic | "High-level visual PDF for board-room reviews." |
| **Enterprise** | **Operational Audit** | Prescriptive | "Comprehensive AI Checklist. Our AI manages your hotel for you." |

## 🎯 Implementation Archetypes

### 1. Executive Strategic Pulse (Option A) — ✅ LIVE
- **High-level synthesis**: DRI/ARI scores converted into board-ready narratives.
- **Quadrant Position**: Visualizing "Value Risk" vs "Growth Opportunity".

### 2. Competitive Battlefield (Option B) — ✅ LIVE
- **Tactical Benchmarking**: Direct head-to-head on Sentiment Pillars (Cleanliness, Service, Location, Value).
- **Threat Detection**: Early warning on competitor pricing shifts.

### 3. Operational Audit Checklist (Option C)
- **Prescriptive Tasks**: AI generates a "To-Do List" based on sentiment deficiencies (e.g., "Improve Housekeeping response time on weekends").

## 🦾 AI Integration Model
- **Prescriptive AI**: (Enterprise) Highest value. Acts as a Virtual GM giving specific orders.
- **Synthetic AI**: (Pro) Leadership value. Translates metrics into strategic "So What?".
