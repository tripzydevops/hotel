# Handoff Note: Hotel Rate Sentinel (Status: Stable - Archi Hardened)

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**To:** Engineering Team
**From:** Antigravity AI Agent

## 📌 Executive Summary
The system has completed a major "Architecture Hardening" phase. We have migrated away from legacy dual-query patterns, implemented structured logging for observability, and dramatically increased the robustness of the Rate Intelligence engine to handle sparse or backfilled data.

## 🚀 Key Deliverables

### 1. Architecture Hardening (Observed & Clean)
- **Structured Logging:** Moved from `print()` to a dedicated `backend.utils.logger`. All logs now include `module_name` and structured context for easier debugging in production.
- **Legacy Cleanup:** Removed all dependency on `query_logs` for pricing analysis. The code now follows a single-source path via `price_logs`.
- **Time-Windowed Fetching:** Replaced `limit(5000)` with a 90-day rolling window (`.gte('recorded_at', cutoff)`) to ensure scalability as the database grows.
- **Service Layer Refactor:** Analysis logic has been moved from `analysis_routes.py` to `analysis_service.py` to follow clean architecture principles.

### 2. Rate Intelligence Robustness (The "Missing Prices" Fix)
- **Data Backfill:** Restored 260 legacy records from `query_logs` to `price_logs` to preserve historical integrity.
- **Horizontal Fill Logic:** The Rate Calendar grid now uses smart estimation. If a competitor has a gap in their scan history for a specific check-in date, it carries forward the most recent valid scan (within a 7-day window).
- **Turkish Room Matching:** Broadened `is_standard_request` detection to support common Turkish variants like "Standart Oda" and "Klasik Oda". This fixed the issue where the grid showed "N/A" for Turkish users.
- **Grid Continuity:** Extended forward-filling for target hotels to ensure the Rate Grid remains populated into the future.

### 3. Code Documentation
- **Transparent Logic:** All critical backend files now feature `# EXPLANATION:` comments.
    
### 4. Background Jobs (Hybrid Architecture)
- **Celery & Redis:** Implemented a worker queue to handle long-running scrapes.
- **Hybrid Deployment:** Vercel handles the API, while a separate VM runs the heavy `ScraperAgent` tasks via Redis.
- **Service File:** Created `scripts/hotel-worker.service` for production deployment.

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Watchlist
- **Market Sentiment:** Some older hotels may show "N/A" in the Advisor Quadrant if their sentiment breakdown hasn't been refreshed post-refactor. A manual "Refresh" on the hotel will fix this.
- **SerpApi Quota:** Now that we are fetching a 30-day window for the calendar, SerpApi usage should be monitored for high-volume users.

## 📝 Next Steps
1. **SQL Migration:** Completed on 2026-02-19.
2. **Room Type Matching:** Logic is now "Hybrid" (Code Defaults + DB Overrides) and "Strict" (No Standard fallback for Suites).
